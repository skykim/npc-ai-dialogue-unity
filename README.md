Winston took the name of his caretaker, created a rocket and flew to Earth where he would join Overwatch. While in Overwatch, Winston invented the chronal accelerator, which helped fellow Overwatch member Tracer maintain control of her time; before this, Tracer suffered from a chronal dissociation which kept her from keeping a physical form in the present.
